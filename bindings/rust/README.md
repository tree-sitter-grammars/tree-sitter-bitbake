# tree-sitter-bitbake

This crate provides a BitBake grammar for the [tree-sitter][] parsing library.
To use this crate, add it to the `[dependencies]` section of your `Cargo.toml`
file. (Note that you will probably also need to depend on the
[`tree-sitter`][tree-sitter crate] crate to use the parsed result in any useful
way.)

```toml
[dependencies]
tree-sitter = "0.20.10"
tree-sitter-bitbake = "1.2.0"
```

Typically, you will use the [language][language func] function to add this
grammar to a tree-sitter [Parser][], and then use the parser to parse some code:

```rust
let code = r#"
    inherit cmake
    VAR = "value"
    do_configure() {
        cmake -DVAR=${VAR} ${S}
    }
"#;
let mut parser = Parser::new();
parser.set_language(tree_sitter_bitbake::language()).expect("Error loading BitBake grammar");
let parsed = parser.parse(code, None);
```

discussions] page.
